Homework 2 - Ground Detection
You have a scene with a ground plane and a player that can move. You can use the Homework 2 Base scene from Ivans Physics exercise.

The task is to write a script that lets the player jump. Jumping is allowed only if the player was previously on the ground (otherwise he would be able to jump to infinity).
